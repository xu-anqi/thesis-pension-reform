## Abstract
Population ageing poses a major challenge to the sustainability of pay-as-you-go pension systems. In response, Germany’s 2007 pension reform gradually raised the statutory retirement age (SRA) from 65 to 67. This thesis examines how that policy change affected private household saving behaviour. Using the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and the Sparen und Altersvorsorge in Deutschland panel (SAVE), I implement a difference-in-differences design that compares employees, who are bound by the new rule, with self-employed workers, who are exempt. To disentangle mechanisms, I match realised saving flows with forward-looking expectations on retirement age and life expectancy available in SAVE.

Extensive-margin analysis using Probit and Heckman-Probit models reveals no statistically significant effect on the probability of saving, while the intensive-margin results for “always-savers” show that the reform reduced logged monthly savings by 0.37. To uncover the underlying channel, I leverage SAVE’s forward-looking modules: the reform increased expected retirement age by around 1.7 years, and shortened expected years in retirement by around 3.5 years. Under the Life-Cycle Hypothesis, a shorter anticipated retirement horizon rationalises the observed drop in savings. Subgroup analysis further indicates that this adjustment was more pronounced among women.

These findings contribute to the literature by providing causal evidence on the effects of pension-age reforms on private saving, identifying retirement expectations as a key mechanism, and highlighting gender-specific responses. The results also suggest policymakers to pair reforms delaying retirement eligibility with targeted tax-advantaged pension schemes or financial-literacy initiatives to vulnerable groups to prevent new distributional gaps in retirement security.
